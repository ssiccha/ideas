# Introduce recognition of large primitive groups into GraphAut algs
- the arising groups are not large primitive but A_m on "johnson graphs"?
- hypothesis: aut group is large primitive. use randomized recognition of large
  primitive groups, at the beginning only perform very cheap tests. Evaluate
  how strongly the tests indicate that the automorphism group is a large
  primitive group. Decide how much time to spend on further testing the
  hypothesis
