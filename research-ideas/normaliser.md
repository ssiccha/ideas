# Matrix groups
- how to backtrack over matrix groups?

# Construction of normaliser of socle for PA type in LV NLTime?
- constructive recognition of simple groups in LV NLTime possible, see
  references.md

# Normalisers
- from Luks and Miyazaki, Normalisers in Poly Time for restricted comp factors
    normalizer problem even for permutation groups naturally leads to instances
    of finding stabilizers of subspaces in certain matrix groups

# How useful is Colva's backtrack in practice?
- try to incorporate it into partition backtrack, implement it in
  backtrack-kit
- if non-abelian socle cases are very efficient: can it improve the abelian
  socle case?
